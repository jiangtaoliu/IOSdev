1. implemented All basic function
    Color: Blue, Red, Yellow, Purple, and Green.
    Shape: eclipse, line, square and free style
    Delete All with confirmation
    Pan gesture drawing with finger
    Support landscape only

2. implemented Advanced function
    triangle
    changing the line of width
    eraser function
    save a drawing to photo album
    for different screen sizes

3. design pattern
    model view controller: view is UI layout, controller is ViewController class, model are specific shape classes.
    strategy design pattern: BaseShape include “point”, and each sub class include itself draw algorithm, it is easy to expand.

4. No third party libraries

5. known bugs:
   save image including buttons, I need to use UIImage to replace view to save image

6. Anything could do better
    I would like to implement a Shape Controller Class to separate some functions from ViewController Class. Currently, ViewController have many function, not easy to change, maintain and extend.

7. I took 120 hours on working on this app.
	I enrolled "Software Defined Network", "Web-based System", "Network Programming" and "IOS development"
    before I completed this app, I had finished "Network Programming" and "Software Defined Network" assignments including paper and programming.
